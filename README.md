  <h1>Minimal YouTube (with navigation!)</h1>
</div>

Minimal YouTube is a boost for the <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc browser</a> that replaces the YouTube UI with a minimal design containing no recommendations, shorts, or distractions.

I also added navigation to the subscription, library, and history pages, since I thought that would be important to access easily.
